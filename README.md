# MB2.PartyLeaderMatters
Mount and Blade II : Bannerlord Harmony Patch.

Gives role XP to Party Leader even when a party role has a companion assigned to it.

Currently, mod gives Party Leader 25% of the XP given to the designated Scout(Scouting), Surgeon(Medicine), Engineer(Engineering) and Quartermaster(Steward)

Assigned companions still receive the same amount of xp as before.
